# skipgram-word2vec-project
This project implements the Skip-gram model with Negative Sampling to learn word embeddings from Wikipedia data.

Due to system limitations, the final training and evaluation were done using Google Colab.

The project includes:

Implementation code
Comparison with Gensim Word2Vec
Word analogy test
Bias detection in embeddings
Note: Due to system limitations, the final training and testing were done using Google Colab. and i can't able upload my embeddings.txt file and enwik9.txt due to they are larger files
